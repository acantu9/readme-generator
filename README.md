# Professional README Generator



## Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

## Installation

To install Inquirer you must first make sure Node.js has been installed. You can check the current version of Node.js by running the command:<br><br>

node -v<br><br>

If the current version of Node.js is not shown use the following steps to complete the installation:

- Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

- On the homepage, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current. It is recommended to download the LTS version for stability.

- Click on the LTS version to start the download.

- Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions provided.

During the installation, you may be prompted to choose additional components or customize the installation. You can generally leave the default settings as they are.

After the installation is complete, open a new terminal or command prompt window and type node -v to verify that Node.js has been installed correctly. You should see the version number printed in the terminal.

To install Inquirer use the terminal to run the command:<br><br>
npm install inquirer<br><br>

## Usage

To use this README generator open the terminal in the respective directory and run the code node index.js. This will initiate a series of prompts for the user. When the user has answered all of the prompts a new, customized file called README.md will be created with the user's input.
